Smart Inventory Management System for Small Businesses

Objective:
Develop a system that organizes, tracks, and processes inventory data efficiently.
The system should allow for fast item retrieval, optimized storage usage to help small business owners make informed decisions.
This will involve using and combining multiple data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps, and trees, depending on functionality.
